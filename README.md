# Linux & Bash Automation Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on Linux system administration and Bash scripting lab work.  
It focuses on building strong foundations in Linux command line usage, shell scripting, automation, and system management.

This is a continuously growing learning repository and serves as a practical portfolio.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice real-world Linux administration tasks  
- Build strong Bash scripting skills  
- Understand system behavior and automation  
- Maintain a structured Linux portfolio  

All labs are designed for learning, experimentation, and practical understanding.

## 🧪 Lab Environment

- **OS:** Linux (Al Nafi Cloud lab environment)
- **Shell:** Bash
- **Execution:** Remote cloud machines provided by Al Nafi International College
- **Focus:** Safe, reproducible learning labs

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder focuses on a specific Linux concept:

- `bash` – Basic commands, file handling, script examples  
- `shell_scripts` – Introductory automation scripts  
- `conditionally-execute-shell-scripts` – If/else logic  
- `loops` – For, while, until loops  
- `cronjobs` – Scheduled jobs and system monitoring  
- `permissions_lab` – File permissions and ACL  
- `system-navigation` – Directory structure and traversal  
- `text-processing` – grep, awk, logs, filtering  
- `processing-input-shell-script` – User input handling  
- `processing-output-shell-scripts` – Command substitution  

Each directory contains practical scripts and example files.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- Linux command line
- File and directory management
- Bash scripting fundamentals
- Conditionals and loops
